# Chat with Your Document Engine

The **Chat with Your Document Engine** is a powerful question-answering chatbot that allows you to interact with your PDF documents using natural language. Built with **FastAPI**, **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **Google's Gemini model**, this system leverages advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to provide accurate and context-aware answers.

## Features

- **Document Upload**: Upload multiple PDFs and embed them into a vector database for efficient retrieval.
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines keyword-based (BM25) and semantic search for optimal document retrieval.
- **Reranking**: Uses a transformer-based reranker to prioritize the most relevant documents.
- **Chat Interface**: A user-friendly Streamlit interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- **Chat History**: Stores and retrieves chat history for each user and session.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts metadata from queries and documents to enhance retrieval.
- **Advanced Prompting**: Uses advanced prompts to improve query rewriting and answer generation.

## System Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Backend (FastAPI)**:
   - Handles document upload, embedding, and retrieval.
   - Manages chat history and user interactions.
   - Integrates with Google's Gemini model for answer generation.

2. **Frontend (Streamlit)**:
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading documents and chatting.
   - Displays chat history and bot responses in real-time.
